# WGU C195 Project
Project for WGU's Software 2 course (C195).

## Project Scenario
You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a scheduling desktop user interface application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; and London, England. The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that your application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems and therefore its structure cannot be modified.

The organization outlined specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. From these requirements, a system analyst at your company created solution statements for you to implement in developing the application. These statements are listed in the requirements section.

I designed my own GUI interface using JavaFX and SceneBuilder following a requirements rubric and the project scenario.  
The database structure was already provided, but accessing and manipulating data was left up to me.

Some key concepts that I found interesting in this course were:
- Using timezones to properly save times to the database
- Different types of exception controls (not just validation, but restraints in implementaion, ie. drop down menus, checkboxes)
- Generating logs and reports
